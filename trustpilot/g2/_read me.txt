3) Open VSCode and navigate to the directory of choice: trustpilot/g2 cj/g2
4) Open the .py script from inside the G2 folder (scraper csv 2024-11-13)

# Define input files
input_files = ["g2_1_20241113.txt", "g2_2_20241113.txt", "g2_3_20241113.txt"] 

6) Save the script
7) Click the run button on the top-right
