Ambra Luparello,1,AU,27-Jun-24,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,User Interface,embarrassingly slow,"I registered because apparently, to start an affiliate program with certain platforms, it's mandatory to go through CJ. I gave up after spending practically half an afternoon completing the 1000 steps required to set up the profile because the site was embarrassingly slow. I found myself having to reload the page multiple times because it would stay blank, and in the end, I gave up.",,,,,

I've been generated sales about 8000$ and finally they sent to me 12$.

I put in a ticket, got an automated response email which I replied to with my questions. No response back.I finally found a couple of numbers for them, one rings and rings and is never answered. The other I get a message if I want to talk to someone go to their website as if that makes any sense at all. I pressed 3 to talk to someone only for the original recording to repeat itself. Seems they have no interest in getting or keeping business.If this is how they treat prospective customers I'd hate to see how they treat existing customers.",,,,,

JW,12,GB,4-Apr-24,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Customer Support,A completely inaccessible company,"I signed up with CJ but didn't feel comfortable with the level of personal information they requested. Rather stupidly I didn't do my homework first. If I had, I wouldn't have touched them with a barge pole as a result of all the appalling reviews! Once I'd signed up I realised affiliate marketing wasn't for me. I spent two hours trying to reach their support page to request my account be deleted only to be directed to a blank page every time. There is no email address. Nothing!I do not feel happy about this company holding my personal details and not having any way of being able to delete my account. Surely this isn't legal?? If a company makes themselves completely inaccessible, to me it indicates they have something to hide.",,,,,
Sucker  ?????,6,US,18-Feb-24,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Payment Issues,DO NOT USE CJ.com UNLESS IT IS YOUR GOAL TO GIVE AWAY FREE ADVERTISING TO THEIR AFFILIATES.,I signed up to use CJ.com while building readership of a family focused website and LOCATE REAL SPONSORS. To test the advertisers services or products I and my website designer purchased services from two affiliate sponsors. In spite of making CJ.com and the company that owed me the largest (hundreds of dollars) commission payment aware of the fact that the company has yet to be paid any of the money due even allowing them over 18 months to do the right thing and pay their bill.  DO NOT USE CJ.com UNLESS IT IS YOUR GOAL TO GIVE AWAY FREE ADVERTISING TO THEIR AFFILIATES.,,,,,

There is no support or help, I wasted time and money on the platform that doesn't pay me. Don't believe positive reviews saying that negative reviews are fake.

Ans Rahim,6,US,5-Mar-24,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Fraud Allegations,"I just got scammed out of $43,450","I just got scammed out of $43,450. The biggest win for them is that my links and tracking links, which I posted along with 220 pieces of promoted content over the years, are still generating sales for them. I will take legal action ASAP and will see how the US government allows this kind of clear scam.",,,,,

Voucher Pages VoucherPages.ie,1,IE,2-May-24,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Payment Issues,Will Not Pay Money Owed so Taking Legal Action Against CJ,"We are a publisher that worked with CJ for over a decade, and they suddenly stopped paying with no good reason a couple of years ago. They are not disputing that they owe they money but are saying they cannot pay due to their system issue verifying company and tax information even though our information has not changed.My company has been trying to get paid by CJ for over a year. Customer service are literally telling lies and sending me around in circles non stop.CJ stopped paying publishers a couple of years ago, and are withholding payment for no reason continuously. They have our company information and tax information but are saying they cannot verify even this even though it is a matter of public record. Their customer service staff are simply being dishonest at this stage.We have added the information, then readded, and emailed time and time again to get this resolved. It is the most incompetent company that I have come across in all my years of business.We have no choice but to take legal action, and submit a claim to the courts in Ireland.",,,,,
Becky Carson,2,US,15-Jun-23,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Positive Experience,Don't believe the hate,"Don't believe the hate! Those who are accusing this platform of being a scam, are either scammers themselves or have no idea what they're doing! They haven't been paid because they've violated terms and conditions that are explicitly set by the network and advertisers that do business there. Don't follow these rules and you won't get paid. Ignore all of the bad reviews.This is the largest affiliate network on the planet and consistently voted the #1 global network by both publishers and advertisers.",,,,,
Tereza,1,CZ,23-Aug-23,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Positive Experience,Overall good job,"The CJ affiliate network is easy for publishers to use - links can easily be generated directly through the browser. CJ offers a large number of affiliate partners from all over the world. For the Central European region, it has excellent affiliate managers who will help publishers. Commission payment works automatically to your account.The negative is the amount of forms you have to fill out to use this network. If you want to change the account number, it is a job of several months. Everything is handled through the headquarters (USA, UK) and these changes take a really long time.Overall good job.",,,,,
Adam Benatar,1,CA,25-Aug-21,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Advertiser Concerns,Don't bother working with CJ,Don't bother working with CJ. Their publishers are mostly off shore coupon sites and review sites that will just insert themselves into your funnel and claim orders you would probably get anyway. Once you want to quit you will be locked into some contract that will cost you even more money.,,,,,
Mr C.S,12,GB,17-Sep-20,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Fraud Allegations,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,Avoid Commission Junction at all costs. It's true from the other reviews of what they do as they did it to us. Don't waste your money promoting their merchants as you probably won't see your commission in return. They'll only deactivate your account. This is one network is best left alone there are many others better than these scammers.,,,,,
Michal Remi≈°,1,SK,5-May-20,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,User Interface,"Problem with provisions, awfully slow GUI","I am publisher. GUI is awfully slow. Provision for sales in 03/2020 is zero, because (as I was told by advertiser) error in CJ system not calculating provisions correctly.

Sabrina M√ºllerov√°,1,CZ,9-Aug-23,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Positive Experience,Great VIVnetworks / CJ support in CEE region,"I really appreciate CJ.com's support, especially their CEE part VIVnetworks. I am promoting several advertisers in CEE using CJ.com and all the time I have gotten prompt support from VIVnetworks / CJ and thanks to this also I am able to follow mainly advertisers' rules about what I can do and what is forbidden. I got all my publisher payment in time. I can highly recommend them. Also what is their advantage is the list of TOP advertisers in my region.",,,,,
traff magic,1,US,11-Dec-20,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Fraud Allegations,These MF's are scammers,"These MF's are scammers. They offer no support to publishers. Even if you earn your commission legitly, they will not pay. They close accounts on payday and never bother to explain why. Also, their support sucks. They are very cocky. Please, Please stay away from them and join some other affiliate network.",,,,,

Boris Razmiki,1,US,21-Feb-23,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Customer Support,I'm baffled as to how this company is‚Ä¶,"I'm baffled as to how this company is still operating. I've been a loyal publisher for 10 years and have generated over $200k in commissions during that time. However, over the past few months, no sales have been registered despite normal traffic flow, and I'm unable to contact anyone for answers. Their phone number is disconnected, and I'm left wondering why reputable brands would continue to work with them.",,,,,
dcwebsiteg,7,LK,3-Jan-22,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Payment Issues,They don't pay affiliate commissions,"Stay away, Total scam. I promoted the Contabo hosting program to my web development clients and first, they reduced the amount of commissions I earned, second, they didn't even paid what left. I sent them an email and no response at all. After seeing the reviews here noticed I'm not the only one this happened so far. Stay far away, otherwise you will ended up wasting your time and effort for nothing.",,,,,
Matthew Armstrong,13,AU,12-Dec-23,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Customer Support,"Not great, not that bad","Not the best, not the worst, customer service is trash, the sourcing and ticketing system is awful, nobody actually try's to help you, the amount of times you hear please submit a ticket"" after you've submitted 8 tickets is awful lol you can't really grow your business with them", as you can't get a dedicated agent who understands your needs, they post heaps of fake positive review aswell, not a good practice.Overall if you're getting started and have some budget don't use them, get a dedicated agent but if you have no budget they are marginally better than ship to the moon.I've been with them about a month now," I'll keep you updated :)"""
RH,3,DE,1-Mar-21,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Payment Issues,Impossible to use for smaller publishers,"If you don't generate constant earnings, they apply a fee to your account and take back what they should owe you until you are at zero, at which point, they deactivate your account. But you also can't get a payout because the minimum threshold for a payout might not be reached. What a terrible system. Like they say: the house always wins"".""",,,,,

For the past few months I have been registering all my name cheap domain names through my own affiliate link on my website and not ONE of them has gone through as commission which pretty much reflects that Commission Junction is either a scam or the coding is no good. I will as a result not be using CJ.com an more. Sincerely Affiliate 5149508,,,,,
Willow Ross,2,US,31-Jan-19,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Customer Support,The most unhelpful affiliate network,These guys are supposedly the biggest affiliate network in the US and I just do not understand why!I have worked in the affiliate industry for over 10 years and have extremely positive relationships with all other networks. CJ are always the odd one out. They seem to almost want to make things difficult. There are publishers with platinum status on other networks that CJ practically ignore. The feedback from publishers is they don't like working with CJ. I wonder if CJ know or even care.,,,,,
A boudreaux,9,US,27-Feb-23,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Payment Issues,This company is a complete scam,"This company is a complete scam! I will be recruiting other affiliates to join me in filing a class action lawsuit against them. they owed me money and the same day they were supposed to pay me my commission, they removed my account for some bogus reason.
