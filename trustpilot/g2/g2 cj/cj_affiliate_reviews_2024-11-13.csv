Verified User in Retail,Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.),,,Yes,Yes,Organic,No,11/15/23,0,"Terrible Program, Negative Impact to Revenue, Full of Coupon/Scam Traffic - No Value, Terrible.","A nice tool to outreach to the database of affiliates. We contacted thousands, no-one ever replied, even ones we know personally never recieved the message. Nice tools in practise, CJ takes your minimum monhtly payment and provided no value, even negative impact on revenue",CJ has only coupon affiliates which means you end up paying for customers you already have or would attract without any impact from CJ. These means your CAC increases. This means it costs you more money to work with CJ,We wanted to join an affiliate program and expand our inhouse affiliate program.
Verified User in Publishing,Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.),,,Yes,No,Organic,No,10/13/23,0,Missing Funds and Unresponsive Customer Support,"The ONLY thing I like about CJ.com is the common advantage of such affiliate platforms: it centralizes performance tracking and earnings from various campaigns into one account, reducing the need to interact with multiple companies or issue numerous invoices. However, the negatives have outweighed this sole benefit. After over a decade of affiliation, the severe issues I faced have led me to transition to direct affiliations with key companies.","I have been an affiliate with CJ.com for a decade now, and over the years I have always found their service to be lacking.","The only advantage is the centralization of affiliations into a single account. But since the earned money disappears without explanations, it's not worth it anyway."
Yashwant P.,Freelance,Small-Business,(50 or fewer emp.),Yes,No,G2 invite,Yes,7/10/23,4.5,One of the best and flexible affiliate advisor,CJ affiliate is one of the best affiliate finder in the as it allows to get better advertising campaigns as per the individual preference and easy to use as well instead of google. Also there is no membership fee for joining this platform. It is the best affiliate program I have ever seen.,Everything is at good place but CJ affiliate requires you to meet their minimum performance threshold otherwise the membership of the affiliate can be terminated from the platform or he/she may not receive any further campaigns.,"While using Google, we have faced problems like controlling our ads over website. But CJ affiliate allows us to choose the best suitable advertisements to show up according to our preference."
Taylor H.,Creative Strategist,Small-Business,(50 or fewer emp.),Yes,Yes,G2 invite,Yes,5/25/23,2.5,It's okay,The software deployment team I worked with initially to launch our program was very kind and helpful. The interface is simple enough.,Kind of costly on a month to month basis without seeing much value back yet. I've already encountered a handful of fraudulent publishers on the platform so I don't think they vet publishers (and perhaps advertisers) well enough.,Helps us connect to wider audiences.
Harinder S.,Small-Business(50 or fewer emp.),,,Yes,No,Organic,No,5/18/23,0,Grab Your Hard Earn Money without any Prior Intimation,The CJ platform has many affiliate programs,Poor customer service,Inferior customer service. No Cooperation from their end to Affiliates or Sub-network.

And have lots of features compared to other networks, which also I like.","What I dislike are their payout methods. I must have a US bank account or use Payoneer. I can't use my bank account directly or receive payment via PayPal. And their minimum payout is also $50, which I don't like.",I'm using CJ Affiliate to join the affiliate program of different brands to promote their products and services via my blog and social media.

User-friendly platform with helpful support and resources for improving affiliate marketing skills. Highly recommended for anyone starting or expanding their affiliate network.","Positive experience with CJ Affiliate, but dislike high minimum payout threshold, the slow approval process for affiliate programs, and limited reporting and analytics tools. Still a valuable platform with a vast network of advertisers and flexible commission structures.","CJ Affiliate solves the problem of finding relevant products to promote by offering a vast network of advertisers.

Meghan E.,Compliance Manager,Consumer Services,,Yes,Yes,G2 invite,Yes,4/18/23,4,Easy to manage affiliates!,I like that you can keep multiple affiliates in one location to help keep track and see any earnings.,May not be CJ Affiliates issue but some companies will never get back to you.

Satyam V.,Founder,Small-Business,(50 or fewer emp.),Yes,Yes,G2 invite,Yes,4/12/23,4,A Reliable Affiliate Marketing Network,"CJ Affiliate Network has many campaigns for different regions, including India and USA. They have a good approval rate for campaigns. If they decline your application, they provide helpful feedback to improve your website.",Their tracking system could use improvement.,CJ Affiliate offers good commissions to its publishers and shares details so that they can connect directly with the advertiser for approval of specific programs. This is beneficial for publishers.
David A.,International Marketing Director,Small-Business,(50 or fewer emp.),Yes,No,Organic,No,3/23/23,0.5,Commission Junction stole our deposit and never give it back (6500$),"If you want to develop your business via affiliation, make your own affiliation program and develop it yourself by contacting directly the sites that are in your niche. Entrusting this task to Commission Junction and Advertising Purple is simply a huge waste of time and money.","This whole sad story started with Advertising Purple contacting us with the promise of growing our online business through affiliate marketing with Commission Junction.  Advertising Purple claims to be the company with the largest number of affiliates in the U.S... something no one can verify and after this unfortunate experience is most likely false.  The cost of working with Advertising Purple + Commission Junction is very high between fixed and recurring fees. You have to pay between $5000 and $10,000 just to cover the future commissions of your future affiliates.  Here's how it really works:  Advertising Purple assigns you an account manager who only publishes your site on bogus coupon code and discount sites. The result is that even your customers who don't normally use coupon codes end up on these sites and ultimately make you lose money because without these sites, they would have bought at the price without a discount. In addition to not making you any money, you have to pay them a commission of course. All they do is bid on your brand name!  These coupon sites do not acquire new customers for you (or very few) but allow people who already know your brand to get discounts...so really NO interests at all.  Advertising Purple and Commission Junction promise you to be affiliated with quality sites (audience, traffic etc.) but in reality they are not. Their network literally stops at very poor quality sites with no interests. As for the account manager, let's call it ""trainee"" with 6 months experience, the word is more appropriate.  We have decided to close our account with both Advertising Purple and Commission Junction. We have been waiting for the return of our deposit at Commission Junction for almost a year now, which is about $6500! Commission Junction is literally stealing from its clients by confiscating the deposit that was given to them at the beginning of the contract. What a shame!  We have contacted our law firm to try to get this money back and our case is ongoing...  If you want to develop your business via affiliation, make your own affiliation program and develop it yourself by contacting directly the sites that are in your niche. Entrusting this task to Commission Junction and Advertising Purple is simply a huge waste of time and money.",They solved nothing

Kristian P.,Senior Webmaster,Small-Business,(50 or fewer emp.),Yes,No,G2 invite,Yes,1/31/19,1.5,Isn't what it used to be,"When CJ started out they had a very down to earth feel. Within the first month of beingvan affiliate with them they had sent me a wooden ""money"" train whistle with their logo on it. It was a way to say welcome and helped me feel welcomed to their company. That feeling is long gone. They have since been bought by a different company and you no longer feel any different then joining any other large affiliate program. They do offer a lot of affiliate programs in many categories and they have competetive commissions. I stopped using them after more then 15 years when they started charging me an inactivity fee, I was sending them traffic but my sales dropped off while I was restructuring my website. As mist people know the affiliate marketplace isn't what it used to be and CJ proves that point all so well.","Inactivity fees, no loyalty to websites that have been with the company for many years, they are much the same as all the other affiliate programs they don't stand out anymore.",Earn money promoting other websites and brands through your own website.
